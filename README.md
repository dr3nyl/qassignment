## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Clone your project
- Go to the folder application using cd command on your cmd or terminal
- Run composer install on your cmd or terminal
- Copy .env.example file to .env on the root folder. You can type copy .env.example .env if using command prompt Windows or cp .env.example .env if using terminal, Ubuntu
- Open your .env file and change the database name (DB_DATABASE) to whatever you have, username (DB_USERNAME) and password (DB_PASSWORD) field correspond to your      configuration.
- Run php artisan key:generate
- Run php artisan migrate
- Run php artisan serve
